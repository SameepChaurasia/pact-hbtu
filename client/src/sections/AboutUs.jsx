      <a className="font-serif font-medium text-sm">  In the capacity of Founder President of PACT, it is a permanent privilege for
              me to welcome the participants of the PACT conferences till I am active and
              serving my beloved field of Paint & Coating Technology.<br/>

              I have always been emphasizing that no engineering industry can finish products manufactured by them until unless they are finished well. More; appropriately, I mean the surface finishing which is the theme or topic of this 5th PACT Conference, i.e., “Changing Scenario in Surface Finishing”<br/>

              I am simply repeating this because I observe that the Engineering industry has already realized it and very cautiously following the same to enhance the sales appeal of their products. The proof is before you. You already see beautiful industrial products everywhere. The necessity of attractive products in the market has created immense opportunity for Paint and Coating Technologists all over the world. It is the surface coating which makes the product attractive. Nothing else can fulfill this requirement. Therefore, the position of a Paint & Coating Technologist in any industrial organization becomes most important. It is he who is responsible for the most important requirement of the manufactured
              product.<br/>

              It is heartening to note that the Paint & Coating industry has been growing faster & faster since last two and a half decades and providing desirable paint and coating products to the engineering industry. I have counted this time period from the inception of Maruti Udyog Ltd. which launched cars for the public in attractive colours other than Blacks & Whites for the first time in the country. Today paint and coating have not only become a necessity but a lifestyle.<br/>

              The formal Paint and Coating Technology Education is today being
              offered by many Engineering & Technological Institutions and Universities in the country both at the degree & diploma levels. I think the time has now come to organize an all India Seminar / Conference / Workshop of the faculty of all the institutions, so that, they may get the opportunity of interacting with each other to evolve the possibility of establishing a common platform or association on an all India basis in order to frame, suggest or review the Curriculum of Paint & Coating Technology in the interest of the Paint & Coating Industry, Paint & Coating user industry and for those engineers who are have not undergone a formal training in
              the Paint & Coating Technology but are actively engaged in the job in which they encounter the problems related to Paint & Coating Technology.<br/>

              I take this opportunity to thank all those persons for their contribution in organizing this conference in such a magnificent form.<br/>

              With these words, I continue to seek blessings of all the Eminent Paint & Coating Professionals for the PACT which is today a decade young.<br/>

              Long live Paint & Coating Technology and the Paint & Coating user Industry.<br/>

        <div className=" pt-3 pl-3 pr-3 flex justify-center items-center">

        <a className="font-serif font-normal text-sm">It was in the year 1975-76 that one day a fresh B. Tech. Paint Technology graduate of 1974 batch, Ms. I Kaushal Kumar came from Lucknow to a senior faculty member of Paint Technology Dr. S. Chandra at HBTI Kanpur with a hand written constitution of the proposed Paint Technologists Association of India (PTAI) and enthusiastically requested to form a PTAI on an all India basis similar to the Oil Technologists’ Association India (OTAI). At that time Dr. S. Chandra and all other faculty members of paint technology were actively engaged in already well-established OTAI and were organizing activities related to paint technology under the banner of OTAI.<br/><br/>

        On the other hand, the number of pure paint technologists at that time was not so large because of the full-fledged B. Tech. Paint Technology Courses in the educational institutions in the country had started only around the late nineteen sixties. Dr. S. Chandra then advised that enthusiastic fresh paint technology graduates form PTAI in the future.<br/><br/>

        It was in 1997, that the 52nd Annual Convention of OTAI was, the first time in the history of OT A1 Conventions, solely devoted to surface coatings by organizing a two day national symposium on “Current Status of Surface Coating Technology” on November 15 and 16, 1997 at HBTI, KANPUR. A senior faculty member of paint technology Dr. Devendra Agarwal was the Hony. Secretary of OTAI (CZ) and the convenor of the symposium. It so happened due to some organizational problem and delay that the convention and the symposium were to be managed within a short span of time of about one and a half months only. When the paint technology faculty members and other technocrats approached the paint industry and local paint professionals to collect funds for the symposium. it was reflected that the time had come to form some sort of paint technologies association and conduct activities on paint technology under this new banner rather than under some ether banner.<br/><br/>

        Thus, the idea which was first conceived by the fresh paint technology graduate in 1975-76 was re-conceived in 1997.<br/>

        During the two days of the symposium on November 15 & 1 6, 1997 where many eminent paint technologists who presented papers and all the delegates from various parts of the country appreciated the idea and showed great enthusiasm for the formation of the new paint technological association. It was then almost immediately after the symposium that on December 7, 1997, a general meeting of the Kanpur local paint technologists was convened by Dr. S. Chandra In which the name of PAINT AND COATING TECHNOLOGISTS’ ASSOCIATION (PACT) was given to the long-awaited organization. An ad-hoc working committee of five members led by Dr. S. Chandra was constituted to raise seed money for establishing the PACT, to frame Memorandum and Rules & Bye-laws, to open a bank account in the name of PACT, to get it registered, to prepare a membership application form, and to carry out day-to-day organizational work of the PACT till the first Central Executive Council (CEC) would be nominated. The Adhoc working committee efficiently performed its duties till September 6, 1998when the first CEC was constituted to administer and execute all the activities of PACT. The PACT was registered under the Societies Registration Act 21, 1 860, at No. 1 1 13 dated 7.10.1998, i.e., within a year of re-conceiving the idea of PACT. Seed money of about Rs. 40,000 was collected.<br/><br/>
        The first meeting for the CEC was held on October 17, 1998, where the following important decisions were taken.<br/><br/>

        1. To organize the Inaugural Meet of PACT on Feb. 20, 1999.<br/>
        2. To hold the FIRST PACT CONFERENCE on sat. and sun. February 20 & 21, 2000. The list of seed money contributors and the membership clearly reflects that the PACT has received overwhelming response and support from technologists’ engineers working in the areas of Paints and coatings, Polymers and Plastics, Printing inks and Packaging Chemical engineering, etc. The contribution of industries related to paints, plastics, printing inks, pigments and dyes, paint application, etc. in noteworthy.
        The paint and Coating Technology, Polymers and Plastic Technology Printing inks and Packaging technology, Pigments and Dyes Technology; Paint application technology and related technologies have today grown to almost a full extent and thus the future of PACT seems to be bright.<br/>
